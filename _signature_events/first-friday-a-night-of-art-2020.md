In returning to his roots, portrait painting, he has found a heightened appreciation for abstraction and an expanded sensitivity for what emotions color and texture convey to the viewer.

The Tointon Gallery presents over ten shows annually to provide enjoyment, education and to encourage dialogue around art.
