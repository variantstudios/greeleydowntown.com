### Tointon Gallery

651 10th Avenue

Carol Jeanotilla and Victoria Eubanks will present their exhibit “Before & After” at the Tointon Gallery. The exhibit will be on display Friday, December 6th through Saturday, January 4th. “Before & After” presents new work that literally and figuratively displays each artist’s journey through life. In Jeanotilla’s case, she is plainly putting the pieces back together through art after a life-altering event. Eubanks, on the other hand, addresses the seemingly simple decisions that ultimately define one’s experiences. It is a joyful collection reflecting both a physical and spiritual transformation. **An artist talk and reception is scheduled for First Friday on Friday, December 6th from 5-7pm** and a closing reception is scheduled for Friday, January 3rd from 5-7pm. The Gallery is open Monday through Saturday 9am-5pm and during many of the performances at the Union Colony Civic Center. The Tointon Gallery presents over ten shows annually to provide enjoyment, education and to encourage dialogue around art.
