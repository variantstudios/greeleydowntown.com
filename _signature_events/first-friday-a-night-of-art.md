The new work of ten guest artists and several gallery artists gives the gallery a fresh look. The featured pieces are thought provoking and vibrant with color. They include functional and decorative pottery, oil paintings, watercolors, acrylics, maple burl clocks, a variety of handmade jewelry, and many other new works.
