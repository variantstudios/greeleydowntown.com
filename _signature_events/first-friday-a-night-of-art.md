#### **Starting Friday, November 8th**

#### &nbsp;

Twenty-eight K-12 art instructors from schools in Weld County will have the opportunity to have their artwork on display in the exhibit “Discovery – Art Educators Inspiring the Next Generation of Artists” at the Tointon Gallery. Ed Rogers, Chair of the Greeley Art Commission and retired Greeley art teacher, organized the exhibit. Rogers is passionate about art education, “the show is about the teachers who inspire all student artists,” says Rogers. In an effort to inspire the next generation of artists, this exhibit provides art teachers the opportunity to exhibit their artwork and highlight their artistic talents that oftentimes go unseen due to the prioritization and time constraints of being a teacher. Several of the art teachers in this exhibit are practicing professionals who juggle teaching with being an artist, where the energy needed to teach, produce art and pursue professional art opportunities is high. This exhibit allows the teachers to take a moment and focus on being a professional artist. The exhibit also allows teachers to demonstrate their artistic abilities to their students and young people alike. The ability to show students and young people that art can be a career path can be incredibly inspiring. The show begins with an opening reception and light refreshments on Friday, November 8 and runs through Saturday, November 30. The artists/art teachers in this exhibit include:
