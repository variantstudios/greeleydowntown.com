This piece is located to the right of the double doors to the swimming pool, allowing visitors to meditate on their relationship with nature when taking a dip into the pool. This newly installed piece celebrates living in the Rockies and outdoor adventure. The piece blends the distinction between realism and abstraction and features layered surfaces and patterns that showcase the depth of the water and the allure and calmness of fish. There is always something new to discover in this piece. The subtle glinting light or the embellished color are intended to provide the viewer with a new experience with each glance. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
