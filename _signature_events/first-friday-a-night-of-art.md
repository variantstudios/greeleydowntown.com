### Tointon Gallery

651 10th Avenue

the Tointon Gallery through Saturday, July 20th. “Sound Energy” seeks to communicate moments of transcendence in live music. Inspired by the energy of rock ‘n’ roll music and the Rolling Stones concert he attended in 5th grade, McGrath has been transfixed with the concept of transmitting the energy of rock ‘n’ roll music into imagery and has been photographing live music for the last 30 years. His photographs seek to capture the energy of live music, and attempt to evoke the excitement and energy of attending a rock ‘n’ roll concert where emotions are running high. For McGrath, art serves as a way to transcend the viewer’s day-to-day life and provide the viewer a front row seat to a concert, all without leaving the galleryAdmission to the gallery is free. The Gallery is open Monday through Saturday 9am-5pm and during many of the performances at the Union Colony Civic Center.
