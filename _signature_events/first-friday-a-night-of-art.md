The Fred Tjardes School of Innovation will host its first museum night of the year on November 2nd. Come out to see the amazing projects the students have created to demonstrate their learning in the Sow Loop! In this loop they have explored seeds. In this exploration they have looked at the physical makeup of a seed, how it is planted, dispersed, and what it needs to grow. This hasn't just been limited to actual seeds, but they have researched metaphorical seeds as well. For instance, they have considered this through questions like how do seeds of an idea form or what are seeds of kindness? They hope you will join them and be a part of the public audience with whom the students may share their learning!
