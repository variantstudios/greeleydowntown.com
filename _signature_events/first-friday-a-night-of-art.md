### Tointon Gallery

651 10th Avenue

Bret Bertholf, a Denver-based artist will present his exhibit “METAL: Recent Paintings by Bret Bertholf” at the Tointon Gallery from Friday, September 6th through Saturday, October 12th. “METAL” presents new work that reflects Bertholf’s study of Renaissance and Baroque European art, his embrace of American Surrealism and his interest in presenting and exorcising fear. A few special events are scheduled:

**October 4**&nbsp;– Artist Talk and Reception – 5 to 7 p.m.

**October 11**&nbsp;– Closing Reception – 5 to 7 p.m.

Concerned with the ways in which society copes with everyday life, Bertholf presents images of darkness and skulls connected to hands in order to explore the society’s connection to death, the past and society’s beliefs. The artist intends to challenge the viewer in showing darkness on the canvas. The uncomfortableness a viewer may feel when looking at his body of work allows the viewer to face their fears head-on and truly consider the meaning of what our mind presents us in darkness. The Gallery is open Monday through Saturday 9am-5pm and during many of the performances at the Union Colony Civic Center. The Tointon Gallery presents over ten shows annually to provide enjoyment, education and to encourage dialogue around art.
