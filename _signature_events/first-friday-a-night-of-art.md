### Tointon Gallery

651 10th Avenue

The Tointon Gallery will be open for First Friday: A Night on May 3rd from 5-7pm and will feature Lina Sanchez, a local artist and graduate student at the University of Northern Colorado. Lina will present her exhibit “Presage” at the Tointon Gallery through Saturday, June 15th. “Presage,” evokes a sense of awe and mystery, created through obscuring the viewer’s perspective with the use of expressive brush strokes, color and shadows. Through this exhibit, Sanchez attempts to capture and display a world within a world, composed with conflicting memories and unfinished thoughts. Inspired by the inherent falsehood of stories, Sanchez plays on the unreliability of memory in her paintings by portraying a fictional character named Lee. Sanchez utilizes brush strokes to hint at what may have already transpired or what may only be a possibility, causing the viewer to question what is true and what is false. The viewer watches as Lee discovers a series of doors that not only leads to different places, but also different times and realities. The painted environments are saturated, yet incomplete. The voyeuristic and illustrative quality in each piece causes the viewer to question the narrative Sanchez has created and their own narratives they’ve created for themselves. Admission to the gallery is free . The Gallery is open Monday through Saturday 9am-5pm and during many of the performances at the Union Colony Civic Center.
