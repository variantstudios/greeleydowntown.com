Enjoy a Downtown Greeley Scavenger Hunt ANYTIME. It's fun to do with family, friends, co-workers. You can choose different "roles" for the people in your group - even kids!!! It takes between one and two hours and the walk is a nice loop through the core downtown area. You'll learn some historical trivia, solve clues, and see creative art. Go anytime on your own schedule! You'll need walking shoes and well-charged phones. It's inexpensive, informative and FUN!
