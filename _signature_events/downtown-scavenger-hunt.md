title: Downtown Scavenger Hunt
description: >-
  Enjoy a Downtown Greeley Scavenger Hunt. It's fun to do with family, friends,
  co-workers. You can choose different "roles" for the people in your group -
  even kids!!!  It takes between one and two hours and the walk is a nice loop
  through the core downtown area. You'll learn some historical trivia, solve
  clues, and see creative art. They found some trivia even we didn't know!!! Go
  anytime on your own schedule! You'll need walking shoes and well-charged
  phones. It's inexpensive, informative and FUN!
