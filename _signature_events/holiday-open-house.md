### 2020 Holiday Open House, Small Business Saturday, Greeley Lights The Night Parade and Park Lighting Ceremony will be Saturday, November 28th, 2020

Celebrate Small Business Saturday and make it a downtown Greeley day on November 28th. Thirty downtown Greeley businesses are hosting a bingo Holiday Open House from 10am-5pm. Pick up your bingo card at a participating business, get it stamped by at least 12 of the participants as instructed and you can enter to win $1,000, $300 or $200 in prizes and gift cards. No purchase necessary.

Most of the businesses are also hosting fun activities and the whole day promises to deliver wondrous holiday magic. Strolling carolers from the Greeley Chorale will delight the shoppers in the late afternoon and will lead some carols in the park immediately following the parade when they light all the Lincoln Park Trees.
