A big&nbsp;**danke schön** to all who came out to make 2019 a successful fundraiser for the DDA - ESPECIALLY to those who braved the rain Friday night. Photos are posted [HERE.](https://www.facebook.com/pg/GreeleyOktobrewfest/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=1699677450169149){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;

Greeley’s OktoBREWfest 2020 will be **September 18th & 19th, 2020**&nbsp;at historic Lincoln Park in Downtown Greeley at 8th Street & 9th Avenue. A little earlier than usual so we don't compete with the Great American Beer Fest in Denver.

Join us at the kick-off on **Friday evening, September 18th from 5-10PM** for some great beer, brats, games, and a free concert.

Then prepare for a full day of fun on **Saturday, September 19th from 11AM-9PM**. Enjoy a whole day of music, a wide variety of craft beer from great Northern Colorado breweries, food vendors, and a huge children’s area with face painting, obstacle course, arcade games, inflatable slide, WOW Bubbles and more\! Kids and adults can also compete in pie eating contests, stein lifting contests, life-size beer pong and more.&nbsp;

### **A HUGE thanks to our awesome 2019 sponsors\! We couldn’t have done it without you\!**
