University Tower Apartments represents an exceptional mixed-use opportunity to acquire a well-located, partially renovated, value-add asset in the growing and improving Greeley community within close proximity to a downtown Greeley, the University of Northern Colorado and Lincoln Park. The project consists of fifty-nine (59) multifamily apartment units and 14,220 RSF of office/retail space on the ground level. The Seller has secured a new ten (10) year lease with a restaurant operator for the 8,220 SF of restaurant space on the south end of the of the building. They have also prepared the adjacent 6,000 SF of ground level office/retail space to be leased, adding new glass store fronts and demoing the old interior walls of the space to create a blank slate for the next owner. This asset presents a potential investor with the opportunity to finish the renovation of the existing fifty-nine (59) apartment units and continue to increase rents well above the current in-place rents. The existing office/retail space can also be leased to further increase net oper&shy;ating income or could potentially be converted into additional apartment units.
