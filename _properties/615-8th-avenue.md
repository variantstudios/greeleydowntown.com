Unique opportunity to own one of Greeley's most prominent downtown historic properties. This high impact asset is well located on a large corner lot with excellent exposure on 8th Avenue. Built in 1911, the property boasts unique architectural elements while maintaining it's historical charm. The second floor multifamily component consists of 19 rented units. These units have a stable operating history, are well maintained, and offer custom cabinets, marble counter tops, mahogany trim and baseboards. The main floor is currently and temporarily occupied by the owner/operator. This level was originally designed to accommodate up to 6 storefronts, but it may be re-purposed for a number of different uses, most likely additional residential units with a mixed-use retail/office component. The building qualifies for a number of incentives based on historic designation with the City of Greeley, location within the Federal Opportunity Zone, DDA/ Downtown Core, and the General Improvement District.
