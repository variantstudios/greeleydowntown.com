Downtown Greeley offers lots of options when it comes to parking, including FREE on-street and surface lot parking.  In general, most of the parking in the core downtown surrounding 8th, 9th, and 10th Streets is FREE with a 2 hour limit.  For more details, review the detailed map below to see what areas are available for parking, and the varying time limits.

Please be aware of permit parking areas, as these are strictly reserved for permit holders from Monday-Friday, 8 am- 5pm.  Permit parking passes can be obtained from the City of Greeley by contacting Joy Meilinger at (970) 350-9737. All are welcome to park in these areas outside of those time perameters.

Also, we understand that some areas are more diffucult than others to accomodate larger and longer vehicles, particularly on 9th Avenue between 7th and 11th Streets, and on 9th Street between 9th and 10th Avenues. So be sure not to park in any space in which your vehicle extends in either the front or the back.  If your vehicle is too long to be parked within the painted parking area, you may find it easier to park in the nearby parking lots or in a parallel space along the street.
