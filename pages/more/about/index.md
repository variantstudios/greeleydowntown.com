A DDA is a special purpose district that is established by voters who live, own or lease property in a defined area. It is governed by a Board of Directors, and is intended to foster economic development and revitalization within a downtown area. Both residential and commercial portions of a city are important and necessary elements of its history, character and vitality.

With projects of all sizes, both commercial and residential, programs for non-profits and individuals, developers and businesses, the DDA approach has been widely successful in downtown areas across the country. Through the use of financial tools for new development, as well as, redevelopment, they are a catalyst for revitalization.

The goal of the Greeley Downtown Development Authority (DDA) is reflected in its Mission & Vision Statements:

Mission:<br>To create, support and promote endeavors that enhance downtown experience, business growth and private development in Downtown Greeley.

Vision:<br>To ensure that Downtown Greeley is an economically-sustainable and welcoming gathering place.

A few of the DDAâ€™s projects and services for downtown include:

* Business support- site location, facade grants, incentive opportunities, marketing & promotion
* Enhanced downtown experience- public art, lighting, maintenance, parking, safety
* Historic preservation
* Redevelopment partnerships
* Special events such as Blarney on the Block, Friday Fest, Oktobrewfest, Trick-or-Treat Street, and more

From entertainment venues to retail stores, professional services to residential spaces, the Greeley Downtown Development Authority is working to create a vibrant downtown.
