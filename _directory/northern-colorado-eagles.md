The Northern Colorado Eagles are a Tier II, Junior A hockey franchise and a member of the Western States Hockey League. This organization is licensed by the Colorado Eagles and is home for many local players as well as players from around the United States, Canada and Europe. The majority of our players move here for 9 months out of the year and stay with a host, or billet, family while they attend daily practices, off-ice workouts, team meetings and games. Our players play a 52 game regular season with potential for more games pending playoffs. Our guys wear half shields, just like the NHL, and play by NHL rules including the ability to fight. Junior hockey is unique because its amateur status provides for an exciting game atmosphere. On average, the Northern Colorado Eagles move 5 to 15 players on to collegiate or professional ranks. Junior Hockey is comprised of players ages 16 to 21 years of age and fills the window of time between a hockey playerâ€™s youth career and collegiate or professional career. Junior hockey is a developmental period for hockey players to hone their physical and mental skillset before entering the college or professional ranks. Junior hockey leagues in the United States are considered amateur and operate within the regions of the country.
