Taste of Philly, Greeley serves delicious, authentic, East Coast cheesesteaks, hoagies, grinders, deli sandwiches, and wraps that are sure to satisfy even the most discerning of customers. On top of our delicious food and exceptional customer service, we value being a positive force in our community. We regularly donate meals to the Greeley Transitional House, A Woman's Place, and Habitat For Humanity among other organizations. To the Transitional House alone we provide nearly 1,000 meals annually! Support local businesses and shop locally right here in your neighborhood and our Greeley community at the same time!

We have made a few changes to better our customer service, delivery times, and order accuracy. We have reduced our delivery area to include all customers between 35th Ave. and Cherry Ave. and 37th St. and O St. Any customers wishing to place orders that are outside of our delivery area can still be placed through Orderup.com and will be received in a timely manor. During the hours of 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. daily, Orderup.com will be our only means of delivery from the restaurant. We would like to thank all of our customers for their &nbsp;continued business.
