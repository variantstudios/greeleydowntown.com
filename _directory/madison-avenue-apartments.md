Madison Avenue Apartments combine the heritage of this distinctive building with modern conveniences. We are conveniently located at the corner of 15th Street and 8th Avenue in Greeley.

Only a couple of blocks from the University of Northern Colorado and minutes from everything downtown Greeley has to offer. Every unit includes a full kitchen with modern appliances and a full bath. Our apartment community is centrally located but tucked just enough away for a quiet space to call home; featuring 44 studio and one-bedroom units. Coming soon, residents will have the option to upgrade their amenity package with access to the Apartments at Maddie’s amenities featuring a resort-style pool, state-of-the-art fitness room, outdoor courtyard, convenient coffee bar, and more – all adjacent to Madison Avenue Apartments.
