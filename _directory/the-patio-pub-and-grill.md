What is the attraction at the Tilted Kilt Pub & Eatery located in Downtown Greeley? It is more than our 40 draft beers on tap. And more than our 40 HDTV's and our mouth watering menu. And even more than our amazing patio, horseshoe pits and putting green. Featuring world famous Kilt Girls, it's the Best Looking Sports Pub on the Planet. Come be our guest at the Tilted Kilt Pub & Eatery: A Cold Beer Never Looked So Good.
