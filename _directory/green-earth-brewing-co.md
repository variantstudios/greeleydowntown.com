Green Earth Brewing Company creates craft beer using Colorado, local, and even Greeley sourced ingredients. We are brewing creatively with our flagship beers being a smooth, drinkable dark beer which we have named Barbed Wire Black Ale and Allez &aacute; Paris, a White Ale, with locally sourced coriander for smooth orange, citrus notes. So, come see us, and cheers\!
