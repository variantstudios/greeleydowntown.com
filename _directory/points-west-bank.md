Points West Community Bank has been a community bank since 1906. Since then, this locally-owned bank has developed into a leading financial service provider. We offer a variety of financial products for your personal and business needs.

As a true community bank, our promise is to provide customers with the best personal service and a wide range of quality bank products. We offer commercial banking, personal banking, free on-line banking, and free bill pay services for both personal and business use.

Being locally-owned and managed gives us the ability to make decisions quickly and to provide more customized products and services. Also, because we do not have the big overhead of other banks, we can pass the savings on to our customers. At Points West Community Bank, we understand that the customer and the community are the most important part of our company. Thank you for the opportunity to serve you\!
