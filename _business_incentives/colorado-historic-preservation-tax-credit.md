Federal and state tax laws provide tax incentives for historic preservation projects that follow the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. &nbsp;These credits allow taxpayers to reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the amount of income tax they owe to the government. &nbsp;The amount of credit that can be obtained is calculated as a percentage of the overall rehabilitation costs associated with the project-

* A 10% federal tax credit for the rehabilitation of older, non-historic commercial properties
* A 20% federal tax credit for the rehabilitation of certified historic buildings used for income-producing purposes
* A 20% state tax credit for the rehabilitation of historic, owner-occupied residences
* A 20% -30% state tax credit for the rehabilitation of historic buildings used for income-producing purposes

Applicants are urged to contact History Coloradoâ€™s Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (OAHP) as early as possible to ensure that all requirements are met when applying for these programs. &nbsp;Our staff can provide advice to owners, developers, and architects concerning appropriate preservation and rehabilitation measures. &nbsp;In some cases, our staff will review applications for tax credits and make official recommendations for approval.
